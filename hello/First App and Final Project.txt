This is the first app of the website thus far. It contains my final project and the home page templates.
My to do list is as follows:

get every button on home connecting to at least a blank page saying "under construction"
Final Project:
	Hit as many of the databases from class as possible
	Use Bio Python to explore Entrez and do some fun things (there are many limitations here)
	use SwissProt, MUSCLE, ncbi, etc
	write paragraph on the known affects and predicted use of this knowledge (site sources)
